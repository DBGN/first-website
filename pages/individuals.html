                    What does it mean to live a more sustainable lifestyle?
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    <br>This is a question we have been asking ourselves since before we founded TerraMundo.
                    <br>So what does it mean to consume mindfully and live a sustainable lifestyle?
                    <br>Sustainable living is often described as a lifestyle that attempts to reduce an individual’s or
                    society’s use of the Earths natural resources, and one’s personal resources.
                    <br> <br><q><i>There is no such thing as ‘away’. When we throw anything away it must go
                            somewhere.</i></q>
                    <br> <br>– Annie Leonard
                    <br />
                    <br>At MundoTerra we firmly believe in the difference each and every one of us can make and ensuring
                    the sustainability of our impact on nature and we are here to help you in making your day-to-day
                    more sustainable as well.
                    <br>We understand that on the surface it can be incredibly daunting to reduce your environmental
                    footprint, especially when you see that others around you are not doing their part. But when you
                    break it down into small steps, you realise you have more power than you thought.
                    <br>This is why we broke the sustainable lifestyle into 3 categories:
                    <ul>
                        <br>
                        <li>Food</li>

                        tomatoes, greens, and herbs.
                        <br>Growing your own grub reduces how much food mileage you imprint on the earth, as well as
                        how many resources are used to get the food to your table.
                        <br> If you live in an oversaturated city, look for community garden spaces where you can
                        participate.

                        harvested for packaged foods and edible oils, both of which have very low nutritional value.
                        <br>The result is that we’re unknowingly eating a lot of food that’s made mostly from soy
                        and corn, both of which waste a lot of resources to make and take over land that could
                        instead be used for fresh produce.
                        <br>The less processed and packaged foods we all eat, the less demand there will be for such
                        products, and hopefully we’ll start to see a lot more land set aside for growing fresh
                        produce that’s going to improve our health.
